CGM Best Practices
==================

A guide for programming well.

General
-------

* These are not to be blindly followed; strive to understand these and ask
  when in doubt.
* Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
* Don't swallow exceptions or "fail silently."
* Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
* Exceptions should be exceptional.
* Keep the code simple.

Object-Oriented Design
----------------------

* Avoid global variables.
* Avoid long parameter lists.
* Limit collaborators of an object (entities an object depends on).
* Limit an object's dependencies (entities that depend on an object).
* Prefer composition over inheritance.
* Prefer small methods. Between one and five lines is best.
* Prefer small classes with a single, well-defined responsibility. When a
  class exceeds 100 lines, it may be doing too many things.
* [Tell, don't ask].

Ruby
----

* Avoid optional parameters. Does the method do too much?
* Avoid monkey-patching.
* Generate necessary [Bundler binstubs] for the project, such as `rake` and
  `rspec`, and add them to version control.
* Prefer classes to modules when designing functionality that is shared by
  multiple models.
* Prefer `private` when indicating scope. Use `protected` only with comparison
  methods like `def ==(other)`, `def <(other)`, and `def >(other)`.

Rails
-----

* [Add foreign key constraints][fkey] in migrations.
* Avoid bypassing validations with methods like `save(validate: false)`,
  `update_attribute`, and `toggle`.
* Avoid instantiating more than one object in controllers.
* Avoid naming methods after database columns in the same class.
* Don't change a migration after it has been merged into master if the desired
  change can be solved with another migration.
* Don't reference a model class directly from a view.
* Don't return false from `ActiveModel` callbacks, but instead raise an
  exception.
* Don't use instance variables in partials. Pass local variables to partials
  from view templates.
* Don't use SQL or SQL fragments (`where('inviter_id IS NOT NULL')`) outside of
  models.
* Generate necessary [Spring binstubs] for the project, such as `rake` and
  `rspec`, and add them to version control.
* If there are default values, set them in migrations.
* Keep `db/schema.rb` or `db/development_structure.sql` under version control.
* Use only one instance variable in each view.
* Use SQL, not `ActiveRecord` models, in migrations.
* Use the [`.ruby-version`] file convention to specify the Ruby version and
  patch level for a project.
* Use `_url` suffixes for named routes in mailer views and [redirects].  Use
  `_path` suffixes for named routes everywhere else.
* Use a [class constant rather than the stringified class name][class constant in association]
  for `class_name` options on ActiveRecord association macros.
* Validate the associated `belongs_to` object (`user`), not the database column
  (`user_id`).
* Use `db/seeds.rb` for data that is required in all environments.
* Use `dev:prime` rake task for development environment seed data.
* Prefer `cookies.signed` over `cookies` to [prevent tampering].
* Prefer `Time.current` over `Time.now`
* Prefer `Date.current` over `Date.today`
* Prefer `Time.zone.parse("2014-07-04 16:05:37")` over `Time.parse("2014-07-04 16:05:37")`
* Use `ENV.fetch` for environment variables instead of `ENV[]`so that unset
  environment variables are detected on deploy.
* Use blocks when declaring date and time attributes in FactoryGirl factories.
* Use `touch: true` when declaring `belongs_to` relationships.

Testing
-------

* Avoid `any_instance` in rspec-mocks and mocha. Prefer [dependency injection].
* Avoid `its`, `specify`, and `before` in RSpec.
* Avoid `let` (or `let!`) in RSpec. Prefer extracting helper methods,
  but do not re-implement the functionality of `let`.
* Avoid using `subject` explicitly *inside of an* RSpec `it` block.
* Avoid using instance variables in tests.
* Disable real HTTP requests to external services with
  `WebMock.disable_net_connect!`.
* Don't test private methods.
* Test background jobs with a [`Delayed::Job` matcher].
* Use [stubs and spies] \(not mocks\) in isolated tests.
* Use a single level of abstraction within scenarios.
* Use an `it` example or test method for each execution path through the method.
* Use [assertions about state] for incoming messages.
* Use stubs and spies to assert you sent outgoing messages.
* Use a [Fake] to stub requests to external services.
* Use integration tests to execute the entire app.
* Use non-[SUT] methods in expectations when possible.

Bundler
-------

* Specify the [Ruby version] to be used on the project in the `Gemfile`.
* Use a [pessimistic version] in the `Gemfile` for gems that follow semantic
  versioning, such as `rspec`, `factory_girl`, and `capybara`.
* Use a [versionless] `Gemfile` declarations for gems that are safe to update
  often, such as pg, thin, and debugger.
* Use an [exact version] in the `Gemfile` for fragile gems, such as Rails.

[versionless]: http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/35717411108/a-healthy-bundle

Relational Databases
--------------------

* [Index foreign keys].
* Constrain most columns as [`NOT NULL`].
* In a SQL view, only select columns you need (i.e., avoid `SELECT table.*`).
* Use an `ORDER BY` clause on queries where the results will be displayed to a
  user, as queries without one may return results in a changing, arbitrary
  order.

[`NOT NULL`]: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ddl-constraints.html#AEN2444

Postgres
--------

* Avoid multicolumn indexes. Postgres [combines multiple indexes] efficiently.
  Optimize later with a [compound index] if needed.
* Consider a [partial index] for queries on booleans.

[partial index]: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/indexes-partial.html

Email
-----

* Use [SendGrid] or [Amazon SES] to deliver email in staging and production
  environments.
* Use a tool like [ActionMailer Preview] to look at each created or updated mailer view
  before merging. Use [MailView] gem unless using Rails version 4.1.0 or later.

Web
---

* Avoid a Flash of Unstyled Text, even when no cache is available.
* Avoid rendering delays caused by synchronous loading.
* Use https instead of http when linking to assets.

JavaScript
----------

* Use the latest stable JavaScript syntax with a transpiler, such as [babel].
* Include a `to_param` or `href` attribute when serializing ActiveRecord models,
  and use that when constructing URLs client side, rather than the ID.
* Prefer `data-*` attributes over `id` and `class` attributes when targeting
  HTML elements.
* Avoid targeting HTML elements using classes intended for styling
  purposes.

[babel]: https://babeljs.io/

HTML
----

* Use `<button>` tags over `<a>` tags for actions.

CSS
---

* Document the project's CSS architecture (the README, component library or
  style guide are good places to do this), including things such as:
  * Organization of stylesheet directories and Sass partials
  * Selector naming convention
  * Code linting tools and configuration
  * Browser support
* Prefer `overflow: auto` to `overflow: scroll`, because `scroll` will always
  display scrollbars outside of macOS, even when content fits in the container.

Browsers
--------

* Avoid supporting versions of Internet Explorer before IE11.

Ruby JSON APIs
--------------

* Review the recommended practices outlined in Heroku's [HTTP API Design Guide]
  before designing a new API.
* Use a fast JSON parser, e.g. [`oj`][oj]
* Write integration tests for your API endpoints. When the primary consumer of
  the API is a JavaScript client maintained within the same code base as the
  provider of the API, write [feature specs]. Otherwise write [request specs].
