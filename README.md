CGM Technology Guides
=====================

Guides for getting things done, programming well, and programming in style. This document is aspirational. We are all human and we acknowedge that we are always constantly growing, learning, and improving ourselves and our development practices. There is no shame in having written code that does not live up to these guidelines. They are, in part, a reference manual for completing common tasks in software development, and partly an ideal of quality of code to which we aspire.

* [Best Practices](./best-practices.md)
* [Process](/process)
  * [Acceptance Tests](/acceptance-tests.md)
  * [Continuous Integration](/continuous-integration.md)
  * [Git](/git.md)
  * [Hosting](/hosting.md)
  * [Pair Programming](/pair-programming.md)
  * [Rails](/rails.md)
  * [Test Driven Development](/test-driven-development.md)
* [Product Review](./product-review.md)
* [Code Review](./code-review.md)
* [Stack](./stack.md)
* [Style](./style-guide.md)

High level guidelines:

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

A note on the language:

* "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
* "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
* "Use" is a positive instruction.
